This project aims to develop a self-driving car using code from python libraries (opencv, tensorflow, keras)
and to merge them with hardware solutions. 

![progress of the self-driving-pi platform](../cover_photo.png?raw=true "self driving pi")

The hardware construction and the code can be found in the upcoming medium blog posts, where I walk through the process of building, connecting and troubleshooting the self-driving pi. 


For the implementation of this project, I will be using the following hardware: T

1x Raspberry pi 3B+
4x Rubber wheels
2x 5v DC motors
1x motor controller
1x 12V power bank
1x Main frame 
1x L298N H-Bridge motor controller
 x cables and miscellaneous
