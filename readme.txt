This project aims to develop a self-driving car using code from python libraries (opencv, tensorflow, keras)
and to merge them with hardware solutions. 

For the implementation of this project, I will be using the following hardware:

1x Raspberry pi 3B+
4x Rubber wheels
2x 5v DC motors
1x motor controller
1x 5V power bank
1x Main frame 
xx cables and miscellaneous
